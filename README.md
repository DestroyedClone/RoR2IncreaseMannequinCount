Risk of Rain 2 only has 5 mannequins (Character Displays): 1 for you, 3 for your allies, and 1 unused. Despite the game supporting more than 4/5 players, there will not be added mannequins for those extra slots. This mod adds a configurable amount of extra mannequin slots, and their relative offsets.

[RiskOfOptions](https://thunderstore.io/package/Rune580/Risk_Of_Options/) and [InLobbyConfig](https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/InLobbyConfig/) support.
